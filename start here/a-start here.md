# This is going to be the basics for python

You guys should have a folder called "repos" that is going to store all your coding folders. It makes it easier to find your code and keep things organized.

If you run into trouble with either python or github, feel free to use stackoverflow or chatGPT. ChatGPT is easier to use and is honestly goated for bugs and errors.

# To run your files, open up your terminal and type:
cd repos
cd python
python hello.py

# It should print "Hello World" in your terminal

What this does, is that "cd" lets you enter into a folder.
cd repos will enter you into your "repos" folder
cd python will enter you into the "python" folder in the "repos" folder
python hello.py will run the script

# If you want to go exit out A folder, do:
cd ../

# For ex:
cd repos
cd python
cd ../

# This will do:
repos -> python -> repos
