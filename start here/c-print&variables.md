***Print***
print('Hello World')

this is a print statement, which will show 'Hello World' into your console when ran


***Variables***
Very differently from C++, in Python, you don't need to declare variable types.

# You can type:
greeting = "Hi"
number = 10
verified = False

# greeting is a string, number is an integer, and verified is a boolean
(Booleans are "True" or "False")
