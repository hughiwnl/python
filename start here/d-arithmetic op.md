***Arithmetic Operations***
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
% for modulus (returns the remainder)
** for exponentiation

# This is kind of self explanatory
result = 10 + 30
result = 40 - 10
result = 50 * 5

# The "/" will return the number as a float 
ie. 10/3 = 3.33 

# and "//" will return a whole number 
ie. 10/3 = 3

# This is modulo which will return the remainder
result = 25 % 2

here, it will return 1, because 2 goes into 25 12 times, so 1 is the remainder

# '**' is for exponention, ie: square, cube, and square root
# This will cube it, so the result will be 5x5x5 = 125
result = 5 ** 3


# This is to find the square root, so square root of 100 = 10
result = 100 ** 0.5


***Plus-equal operators***

// Consider this:
result = 1
result = result + 1

// This will return 2

// This can also be rewritten as:
result = 1 
result += 1

// Which will also return two

They will both return the same thing, you can also do
the same for subtraction and division:

result = 1 
result -= 1
// this returns 0

or

result = 2
result *= 2
// this returns 4
